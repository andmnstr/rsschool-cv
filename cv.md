#### About myself
I was started my career as Service Engineer after getting graduation in Institute. At my first job I have got a lot of practice and work experience, that helps me to explore new levels of my profession.

I got a lot of self-education activities as programmer. A main direction was process automation. On this direction I got knowledges like programming PLCs,organizing SCADA-systems, network settings, PC settings, OS administration, etc.

Three years ago I got a job in Steelmaking Factory as a Senior Engineer-programmer. Then I began studing web-development. HTML, CSS, JS - all of this now interesting for me. And now I want to make it possible - be Frontend Developer.
